Every living organism needs water to survive. It is nature's most priceless gift because it aids in survival. South Africa has been dealing with a water deficit since 2015. 
This is primarily due to climate change, which results in delayed rainfall that finally lowers dam levels and causes drought throughout the nation to address the lack of water. 
People need to be informed about the value of water and encouraged to think about it more.

The problem in our community is water crisis, where   there is a scarcity of clean and accessible water. 
The target group affected by this problem is the entire community, but certain groups maybe more vulnerable, such as those living in poverty or in remote areas without access to clean water sources. 
The solution to this problem would be to implement sustainable water management practice and promote water conservation and educational programs such water crisis awareness and application development. 

The solution we've suggested would assist the community in tracking their water usage. If they run out of water during the month, they will need to buy the number of litters they need through this application and pay their bills there as well. 
Each household will be given 500l per month then the application will show you the full bar of water.
